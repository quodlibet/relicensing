Ok. Well, I don't recall if that was a bug report, a patch, or just based
on describing the correct fix - and I'd probably argue that this patch
isn't significant enough to be copyrightable anyway.

However, if you do want to consider this mine:

I, Michael Smith, hereby make all my contributions made to mutagen [1] and
Quod Libet [2] available under the terms of the "GNU GPL version 2 or later"

&gt;<br>
&gt; I don&#39;t recall having contributed directly to either of these proj=
