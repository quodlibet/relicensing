Relicensing quodlibet from GPLv2 to GPLv2+
------------------------------------------

I've contacted everyone I found from the git blame/log, credited in the commit
logs, credited in the copyright header and credited in the NEWS file.

The following credits I either couldn't find contact information for, didn't
contact because it was not needed or I contacted them and they didn't respond.
Luckily they are all from old contributions (pre github/google code) which no
longer exist. See each entry for details:
