I, Jeremy Evans, hereby make all my contributions made to mutagen [1]
and Quod Libet [2] available under the terms of the "GNU GPL version 2
or later" [3].

[1] https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen
[2] https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet
[3] https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt

I will state that I would prefer keeping mutagen GPLv2 only, but as my
contribution was small and I haven't been an active user of mutagen in
many years, I don't want to hold back your relicensing effort or force
you to rewrite the related code.

Thanks,
Jeremy
